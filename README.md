# Netclean 

This **REACT JS PROGRESSIVE WEB APPLICATION** was developed for an industrial cleaning company. 

Previously, their inspectors at various work sites had to report their evaluations on paper and then bring them to the head office, where they would be manually entered into an Excel file. The purpose of this app was to digitalize the process by using a tablet to collect and send the data directly from the work sites to the HQ via a **FIRESTORE** database, thus saving the company a significant amount of time, resources, and money. Additionally, it enables selected customers to directly access the reports made in their premises. 

# FRONTEND 
The frontend was created in **React JS** and styled mostly in **Sass** with some elements in **Material UI** and **react-bootstrap**.
